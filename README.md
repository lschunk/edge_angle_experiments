# edge_angle_experiments
This repository contains all edge angle data from three diffferent experiments (initial experiment, artificial VS natural experiment, tool function experiment). 
The data results from sequential experiments and compares the edge angle of the tools from before, after 50, 250, 1000 and 2000 strokes.
The repository is related to the following monograph: Understanding Middle Palaeolithic asymmetric stone tool design and use.
